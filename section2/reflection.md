## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  I feel like I tend to wait too long to ask questions, or have fallen down the rabbit hole of trying to find an answer to an overly specific question on google. In the past, I've had trouble asking for help, or I guess it'd be better said that I've had trouble determining who best to ask for help, as the problems I had faced were involving very specific knowledge of my own languages and experience, very specific shared knowledge involving our company's software, and then also had some language barriers with people working around the world, as well as gaps in my knowledge from lack of formal programming training.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  A lot of this has been review for me, but it got me back into the habit of googling and researching when I have a question. For me, it was very comfortable. It helped highlight some of the pieces of knowledge that I was missing and helped refresh my knowledge, since I haven't used most of it in a few years.


1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
  A conditional statement, in programming, is a piece of code that tests a variable against a certain condition, and executes code based on whether or not those conditions were met. These could be if, else if, or else statements.
  An example of a daily life conditional could be when I wake up in the morning, *if* I'm hungry I'll have breakfast, otherwise I'll take a shower.
  An example of one in a web app could be for utilities or car insurance websites - if you have an upcoming bill, the website might send you an email to alert you of the upcoming bill, but only if you haven't already paid it.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
  You're able to add multiple "if" statements together by using the "else if" statement after the first "if" statement. The statements will only run in order, so if the condition is met for the first "if" statement, the subsequent conditional statements won't be read.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
  To check if multiple conditions are met, you can use logical operators to create "and" (&&) and "or" (||) statements within the "if" statement. The program will only execute the code if both or either condition is met, depending on which operator is used.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
  In general, is it acceptable to nest if statements, or is that only reserved for very large blocks of code?
