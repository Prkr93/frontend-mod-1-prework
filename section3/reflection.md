## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  I really felt the part in the video where having a fixed mindset about something, a lot of times, can feel like it's something that you can't change, and then ends up being something you can't change. The hopelessness that comes from it and the cycle it starts. The part where she talked about just doing what you need to do to get where you want to go, and to not comparing yourself to others but instead comparing your progress made a lot of sense.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  I feel like I demonstrate a growth mindset in many aspects of my life, in school, work, daily life. There have been aspects in my life where I have fallen into a fixed mindset, like with my health when too many problems arise that I don't know how to fix, or I can't personally fix and have to rely on others.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

  User's account information is stored in objects and arrays in many websites so that all the information; ie email, name, credit card, birthday; can be stored together and accessed for different functions.


1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  An array method is a built in function for the array data type, including push, pop, shift, unshift, and others. These functions give developers an easy way to manipulate arrays and their stored data.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

  The purpose of a loop is to perform an action over a collection of items, an array or object. We'd use a loop if we want to change or check a value, or even print out something for each item in the collection. If we only wanted to access one specific variable, then we wouldn't use a loop.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

  I would give them an example of if we wanted to hug every one of our stuffed animals, we could put them in a line. This line would now be our "array", because every animal has their own place in the line. Then, we can perform a loop, hugging every one in a row. That way, no animal gets left out.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

  I feel like I'm not quite sure the different between an array and an object, and I feel like a lot of the examples I came up with for arrays could have been objects, too. What is the main difference between them? Is it just circumstantial, and it depends on what type of data you are storing? Or is it more that arrays should be used for a collection of similar items, while an object groups together different attributes of a "thing"?
