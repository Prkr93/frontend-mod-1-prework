## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  I felt they were very good suggestions for long term health and happiness. I enjoy teaching and have always viewed learning as a process, striving to understand rather than just get the right answer. I've feel like I've grown so much recently in many aspects of my life, and have been working on adopting this mentality of growth for a long time.

  Something I need to start doing more of is taking *productive* breaks. I feel as though many times I don't spend my few minutes that I'm distracted productively, and I end up spending longer than I should, which causes me to take less breaks, and the cycle continues. I'm working on that, though! Something I may add is to just take care of every aspect of your health - physical/mental/emotional/social/financial/spiritual - just whatever "health" means to you. All of these things play into each other, and being in a good headspace is key to learning and performing.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
+ string - a word, phrase, or text wrapped in quotations.
+ integer - a numerical value. In javascript, it can be a whole number or a float.
+ boolean - a value of either true or false.
+ array - a list or collection of items, surrounded by hard brackets and separated by commas.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
$console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
+ // for shorter/inline comments

or
+ /* for longer/multiline comments */

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a placeholder for something that can store information, and then be used to do an action or make a calculation.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
+ username - string
+ loggedIn - boolean
+ age - integer

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation uses the addition operator, and is similar to addition in that it is adding data together, but it allows for the addition of unlike data types. For example, you could concatenate different variables to produce a sentence, even if the variables are ranging from integers, strings, booleans, etc.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
When I'm logged in, many sites will say "Hello Dillon!" at the top. I would assume they use concatention to produce this, using a variable for the user's name and appending it to "Hello ".

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Why does the terminal command "rmdir" exist? I've tried looking it up, but very little answers as to why I'd use it, other than a failsafe, but it doesn't do anything that "rm -rf" doesn't do, just that it isn't "destructive". Is it more of a command that is used in production for environments that might not match the developing environment, and therefore prevents data loss?
